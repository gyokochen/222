<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/gyokochen/devchallenges-front-end-developer/blob/master/button-component-master/button-component-screenshot.png)

- My demo is available: https://challenges-front-end.netlify.app/buttons

- Through this practice, I have basic understanding of Reactjs.

- I spent time on functions, style and interaction, I also create a main page using router.

- My wisdom: Divede different types of buttons in different functions. So it's easy to read and reuse.
