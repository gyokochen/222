<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/gyokochen/devchallenges-front-end-developer/blob/master/button-component-master/button-component-screenshot.png)

- My demo is available: https://challenges-front-end.netlify.app/inputs

- Through this practice, I have deeper understanding of Reactjs.

- I spent time on functions, style (especially inpu with icon) and how to change parent element style while hoving child element by reactjs.

- My wisdom: Divede different types of buttons in different functions. So it's easy to read and reuse, use reactjs to change parent element style.
